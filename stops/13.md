   alt_text: Watchman Nee Commending Witness Lee in Manila
---

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
One evening while he was in Manila, Brother Nee went for a walk by the seaside with some brothers. During their fellowship, he cheerfully shared, “I met a brother in northern China with a very bright spiritual future.” Brother Nee was referring to Witness Lee. He continued, “His spiritual growth is extraordinary. Others grow as if crawling, but he is flying. I gave him a Bible with notes…”

Thus, 1937 marked the first time the brothers in Manila heard about Witness Lee. Brother Lee was saved in the northern city of Chefoo in April 1925. By June 1932, he met Watchman Nee for the first time in Chefoo when Nee accepted his invitation to visit. A year later, in 1933, after much prayer and seeking before the Lord, Witness Lee dropped his job and his own spiritual work in Chefoo to join Watchman Nee's work in Shanghai. He had seen the light from the book of Acts that there is only one work, one flow, in the Lord’s recovery. Thus, he willingly and gladly handed himself over to do the same work with Watchman Nee.
