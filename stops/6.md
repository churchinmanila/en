<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At this juncture in history, in the bustling city of Manila, over a thousand kilometers south of the Chinese coast of Fujian, lived a sizable population of overseas Chinese who had migrated to the Philippines to escape economic hardship and political instability in China. Many of them were Christians who gathered at St. Stephen’s parish, an Anglican-Episcopalian church in Manila.

Among them was Brother Huang Ho Seng, a medical practitioner whose clinic once stood on the very ground where this History Center stands today.

In 1930, Huang Ho Seng and his newlywed wife went on a honeymoon to Xiamen, China. There, by the Lord’s sovereignty, he touched the flow of the Lord’s recovery. Upon his return to Manila, Brother Huang enthusiastically shared his newfound enlightenment with some fellow believers. Inspired by his testimony, a group of them decided to leave the Anglican-Episcopalian sect. They rented a place on Nueva Street and began meeting under the name of United Christians Society.

In 1935, the brothers invited Leland Wang, a contemporary of Watchman Nee under M.E. Barber, who by then had become a traveling evangelist, to come to Manila to hold gospel outreaches and revival meetings. Following these meetings, Brother Wang recommended his co-worker, Simon Meek, to come and serve in Manila. Three years later, Lucas Wu, another co-worker from China, joined the work in Manila at Brother Meek's request.
