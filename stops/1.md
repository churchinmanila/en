   alt_text: Spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire
---

Christianity spread rapidly from the Mediterranean to Europe, largely through imperialism. Concurrently, degradation crept in and the truths in the Bible were almost entirely lost by the time of the Dark Ages.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Our story must begin with how the Lord’s recovery flowed to the virgin soil of China. 

Midway through the first millennium, the gospel had spread from the Mediterranean Sea to Europe largely through imperialism. However, with the intermixture of religion and politics, the church experienced degradation and decline, as described by the apostle Paul in his later epistles and by the apostle John in the book of Revelation. By the end of the sixth century, the truths in the Bible were almost entirely lost, plunging the world into what we now know as the Dark Ages.
