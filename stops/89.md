This stop is to test the following:
- Stop with a photo but without an audio (just in case we need it).
- No section title and no title
- Stops without section title does not show up in stop list 
- Gif animation as photo
- To see how the gap in the numbering (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 88, 89) will affect navigation arrows left and right.
