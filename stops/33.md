History taught us that many had paid a great price to bring us the gospel, truth, life and the church. May we deeply treasure the all-inclusive Christ revealed to us and faithfully live the practical church life on the ground of oneness. Until we all arrive at the New Jerusalem, let us steadfastly journey on, continuing to write the divine story in our human history!

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Dear brothers and sisters, history taught us that many lovers of Christ throughout the centuries had paid a great price to bring us the gospel, truth, life and the church. Today, may we deeply treasure the all-inclusive Christ revealed to us and faithfully live the practical church life on the ground of oneness. Until we all arrive at the New Jerusalem, let us steadfastly journey on, continuing to write the divine story in our human history!

Please enjoy the rest of the History Center by looking at the various photos on the walls and the collection of memorabilia on the shelves. Each item and picture holds a piece of the rich history and legacy of the Church in Manila. 

Thank you for joining us in this journey.
