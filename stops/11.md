<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Back in July 1937, before Brother Nee’s arrival, the church in Manila had planned to advertise the conference in newspapers and hang big banners on the streets to promote Watchman Nee, as was commonly practiced among preachers and evangelists. However, when Brother Nee learned of this, he adamantly opposed using human methods and propaganda for God’s work. He even threatened to call off the conference if the brothers did not cease the advertisement and promotion. The conference eventually proceeded, but only after all the publicity activities were halted.
