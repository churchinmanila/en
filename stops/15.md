<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In 1941, the Philippines fell under Japanese occupation. For a time, the Japanese did not allow the church to congregate. Through prayers in one accord, the church passed through this dark period of trial and reemerged with hope. Soon, the meetings of the church were restored, and the gospel prevailed amid the climate of fear and apprehension in people’s hearts. The number of those being saved steadily increased.

By 1945, American troops arrived to liberate the Philippines, forcing the Japanese troops to retreat, but not without wreaking havoc along the way.
