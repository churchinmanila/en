<!--- TRANSCRIPT
While the enemy utilized man’s flesh to carry out damaging work, the Lord, in His sovereignty, performed a sanctifying work. During the turmoil, Brother K.H. Weigh (also known as Weigh Kwang-hsi), a co-worker trained under Watchman Nee who eventually served in Hong Kong, was greatly used by the Lord to supply and support the excommunicated elders in Manila. Recognizing his spiritual capacity, Brother Witness Lee personally requested Brother Weigh to go and provide help to the church in Manila during those turbulent days.
