“I can see that the work of sowing, planting, and watering during those eleven years has yielded fruit…This work is not of man but of God.”

Witness Lee on the Condition of the Church in Manila in 1984
CWWL, 1984, vol. 5, “Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel — The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery,” ch. 2

我…看見那十一年間所作撒種、栽種、澆灌的工作，的確有果效。這都不是人的工作，乃是神作的，是神叫他們生長。
李常受於1984年在馬尼拉召會

「真理．生命．召會．福音－主恢復中的四大支柱」第二篇

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In November 1984, fifteen years after the turmoil of 1961, when Brother Lee returned to the Philippines and held a conference in Quezon City, he spoke about the history of the turmoil in Manila. Seeing the church’s condition then, Brother Lee expressed encouragement, saying, “Today I am very happy and at ease because I can see that the work of sowing, planting, and watering during those eleven years have yielded fruit. At that time some of the brothers were still small “tree seedlings” — only sprouts with hardly any growth. Today those brothers have become elders... Thank and praise the Lord. This work is not of man but of God; it is God who causes such ones to grow.”   

Brother Lee testified that during those eleven years from 1950 to 1961, he did not do the work of an organization; rather, bit by bit he was doing an organic work. Thus, the organic function of the living organism, the Body of Christ, manifested itself with spontaneous growth and fruit-bearing.
