Brother Lee testified that during those eleven years from 1950 to 1961, he did not do the work of an organization; rather, bit by bit he was doing an organic work.  Thus, the organic function of the living organism, the Body of Christ, manifested itself with spontaneous growth and fruit-bearing.  

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In November 1984, fifteen years after the turmoil of 1961, when Brother Lee returned to the Philippines and held a conference in Quezon City, he spoke about the history of the turmoil in Manila. Seeing the church’s condition then, Brother Lee expressed encouragement, saying, “Today I am very happy and at ease because I can see that the work of sowing, planting, and watering during those eleven years have yielded fruit. At that time some of the brothers were still small “tree seedlings” — only sprouts with hardly any growth. Today those brothers have become elders... Thank and praise the Lord. This work is not of man but of God; it is God who causes such ones to grow.”
