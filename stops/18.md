<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At that time, Brother Lee was already in Taiwan. In 1949, when it became apparent that the Communists would prevail in China, Brother Nee insisted that Brother Lee emigrate to carry on their work in Taiwan and throughout the Far East; Brother Lee agreed. 

Meanwhile, in 1946, the Philippines had also become an independent country, and the Philippine government restricted the entry of Chinese citizens. Therefore, it was difficult for Chinese people to obtain a visa. 

It was not until the end of 1950 that the travel papers of Brother Lee were successfully processed, and a visa was obtained. Thus, on November 17, 1950, Witness Lee finally set foot on Philippine soil for the first time.

Initially, Brother Lee was given hospitality at the meeting hall in Soler Street. However, due to the presence of many mosquitoes and insects, on the third day of his visit, Brother Lee contracted a severe case of dysentery and was rushed to the emergency ward. By the Lord’s mercy, he recovered.
