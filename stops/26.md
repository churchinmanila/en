<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Yet, as God was working, the enemy was also fiercely active. During the appointment of the elders, the two senior co-workers, Brothers Meek and Wu, who had previously served as elders, were not reappointed. 

Eventually, they became dissenting ones and led opposition against Brother Lee. In 1961, turmoil erupted in the church in Manila, leading to days of chaos. The dissenting ones wrote on a long bench in the meeting hall: “Down with the four elders; cast out Witness Lee.” 

One morning in August 1961, an elder who usually attended morning watch at the meeting hall found four security personnel standing guard, with a notice posted on the door declaring that no one without the express permission of the Board of Trustees could enter. The meeting hall had been taken over. The four new elders urgently sent a telegram to Brother Lee in Taiwan to inform him of the situation. At that moment, Brother Lee pondered, “Will there be any result of my sowing, planting, and watering there for the past eleven years?” During the period from 1950 to 1960, he had spent one-third of his time in Manila and two-thirds in Taipei.
