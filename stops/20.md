<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Before we continue sharing how Brother Witness Lee helped the church in Manila, let's insert a short story about a brother named Wang, whom Brother Lee met on this trip. This brother had a significant impact on the work in Taiwan during its early stages.

While in Manila a few days before his return to Taiwan, Brother Lee was informed by Brother Huang Ho Seng that a certain Brother Wang wished to speak with him in private. At that time, Brother Wang had a very large business in the Philippines. He came alone to see Brother Lee and said, “Brother Lee, I have a burden for the work you are doing in Taiwan. Please tell me the amount of funds necessary for the entire work of the Lord in Taiwan when you return this time. Also, let me know the funds needed for the work in Taiwan every year, and I will offer the entire amount.”

Brother Lee replied, “Brother Wang, I would like to let you know that we have learned to serve the Lord since our youth, and one thing we learned is to never tell others about our needs and never ask for donations.”

Brother Wang responded, “Brother Lee, I absolutely know this principle. But you must know that you did not come to talk to me; neither have you asked for a donation; it is I who am entreating you. You are for the Lord, and I am also for the Lord. I came to entreat you; you must tell me.” 

Under such a circumstance, Brother Lee sensed that this was of the Lord, so he disclosed the amount. Brother Wang proved to be truly faithful. From 1951 to 1960 or 1961, he faithfully fulfilled his commitment each year.

Due to the financial provisions from Brother Wang, the original small meeting hall in Taipei was demolished and replaced with a larger one. Additionally, the funds were used to purchase land for halls two, three, and four, as well as a twenty-eight thousand square-foot plot for the Kaohsiung meeting hall. This support also enabled Brother Lee to initiate the publication of The Ministry of the Word in 1951 and to hold the first training in Taipei in 1952, which produced 80 to 100 full-time serving ones. The Lord’s work in Taiwan experienced significant growth and progress during this period.

One time, Brother Wang fellowshipped with Brother Lee, saying, “Brother Lee, I can tell you that sometimes I had to borrow the money to offer to the Lord because I did not have it.” Upon hearing this, Brother Lee was deeply moved, almost to tears. He would never forget the brothers and sisters of this family and earnestly prayed for the Lord’s abundant blessings upon them. Brother Wang is the older sibling of Betty Ong, one of the two sisters appointed by Brother Lee as a deaconess in 1951.
