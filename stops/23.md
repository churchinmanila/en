<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Between 1951 and 1954, under Brother Lee's leadership, the eldership in the church underwent gradual changes. Initially, two of the previous elders, namely Chang Pan and Liu Ai San, were retained, but Chang later migrated to Brazil, and Liu resigned due to old age.

Four new elders were added during this period: Hwang Lien Seng and Gan Bong Kak in 1951, and Tan Giok San and Chang Ka Fu in 1954. As adjustments were made to all services, the church became very active in preaching the gospel, resulting in an increasing number of people being saved.
