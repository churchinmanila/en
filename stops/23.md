When Brother Lee arrived in Manila in 1950, he found the condition of the church to be less than ideal. The church life was stagnant, with little fruit-bearing, and the organic function of the saints was not evident in the services. Recognizing the need for change, all three groups of serving ones — the elders, the co-workers, and the deacons and deaconesses — humbly confessed their shortcomings and willingly handed over the leadership of the church entirely to Brother Lee. They earnestly requested him to take charge of the church, the work, and all the services. Brother Lee acceded to their request.
