Before 1937, the saints in Manila “did not receive direct help from Watchman Nee; they were helped indirectly through his publications... This was an unclear beginning.” 

- Witness Lee

在一九三七年之前，馬尼拉的聖徒「並未直接從倪柝聲那裏得到幫助；他們是通過他的出版物間接得到幫助的... 這是一個不明確的開始。」
-李常受

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At this time, the church in Manila had moved its meeting hall to Gandara Street and changed its name to Christian Assembly Hall, registering with the government as the Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel. 

It was apparent that the saints lacked clarity about some of the truths the Lord was recovering at the time. Until then, they had not yet received direct help from Watchman Nee, only indirect help through his publications. Witness Lee would later describe this historical period of the church in Manila as “an unclear beginning.”
