At this point, the church in Manila lacked clarity about some of the truths the Lord was recovering. Until then, the saints had not yet received direct help from Watchman Nee, only indirect help through his publications. Witness Lee described this period of the church in Manila as “an unclear beginning.”

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
At this time, the church in Manila had moved its meeting hall to Gandara Street and changed its name to Christian Assembly Hall, registering with the government as the Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel. 

It was apparent that the saints lacked clarity about some of the truths the Lord was recovering at the time. Until then, they had not yet received direct help from Watchman Nee, only indirect help through his publications. Witness Lee would later describe this historical period of the church in Manila as “an unclear beginning.”
