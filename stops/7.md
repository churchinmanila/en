Among them was Brother Huang Ho Seng, a medical practitioner whose clinic once stood on the very ground where this History Center stands today.

In 1930, Huang Ho Seng and his newlywed wife went on a honeymoon to Xiamen, China. There, by the Lord’s sovereignty, he touched the flow of the Lord’s recovery. Upon his return to Manila, Brother Huang enthusiastically shared his newfound enlightenment with some fellow believers. Inspired by his testimony, a group of them decided to leave the Anglican-Episcopalian sect. They rented a place on Nueva Street and began meeting under the name of United Christians Society.
