<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the early 1920s, the Lord gained a group of young, fervent Chinese brothers in the southern city of Foochow, among whom were Leland Wang, Watchman Nee, and Faithful Luke. They received help and mentorship from Margaret E. Barber, a British missionary with informal ties to the Plymouth Brethren. These young men, schoolmates from different cohorts at the Anglican Trinity College, grew up with a Western-style education. After graduation, they ardently consecrated their lives to preaching the gospel instead of pursuing more lucrative careers.
