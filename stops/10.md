   alt_text: Watchman Nee's Visits to Europe and America
---

Thank the Lord, in 1937, the opportunity opened up for Watchman Nee to stop by Manila on his way to England. That year was a pivotal moment in Brother Nee's life. Earlier, he had visited the Brethren Assemblies in Europe and America and personally witnessed the great division among them. In one city, there was often a Brethren assembly on one street and another Brethren assembly on another street. In Vancouver alone, there were 30 independent assemblies, none of them having anything to do with the others. 

Brother Nee returned to China with a heavy burden in his spirit.  He searched the Scriptures to study the boundary of a local church. By the time he came to Manila in July 1937, he was very clear that the boundary of a local church is the boundary of the city where the local church is located. This ground, he believed, was essential to preserving oneness and avoiding division among believers.
