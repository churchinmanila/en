<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Once he got off from the ship, Brother Nee was ushered to the home of Brother Huang Ho Seng and his younger sister, Ng Chu Ai. Remarkably, the house where Watchman Nee stayed is located on the very ground you stand on today, now the site of Meeting Hall #2 of the church in Manila! Years earlier, Brother Sammy Chan, the only grandson of Ng Chu Ai and grandnephew of Huang Ho Seng, generously offered this property to the church at a below-market rate before emigrating to the United States to pursue a career in medicine.
