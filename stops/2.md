During  the 2nd millennium, the Lord used a number of faithful believers to recover different items of the truth.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Despite this, the Lord continuously moved to carry out His work of recovery among groups of believers who often faced persecution for seeking the truth. During the second millennium, several groups of faithful ones recovered item after item of the truths that had been lost through long periods of neglect, oversight, or opposition. Still, by the late 1800s, the situation in Europe and America had become exceedingly confused, with Christians deeply divided due to the conflicting influences of Roman Catholicism, state churches, and private or independent churches.
