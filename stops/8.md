In 1935, the brothers invited Leland Wang, a contemporary of Watchman Nee under M.E. Barber, who by then had become a traveling evangelist, to come to Manila to hold gospel outreaches and revival meetings. Following these meetings, Brother Wang recommended his co-worker, Simon Meek, to come and serve in Manila. Three years later, Lucas Wu, another co-worker from China, joined the work in Manila at Brother Meek's request.
