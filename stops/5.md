<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the first half of 1922, having seen the light about the error of denominations, Watchman Nee, Leland Wang, and his wife took the bold step of breaking bread in Wang’s home instead of going to the denomination to receive communion. Watchman Nee later testified that he would never forget, even in eternity, the profound closeness to the heavens he felt that night. Thus was born the church in Foochow, Fujian province, standing firm outside the division of the denominations.  

這時距離福建南邊外海的千公里之外的繁華之市馬尼拉也正好住著一批為了逃離內地的經濟困境和政治的不穩而移居到菲律濱的華僑。他們好多人都是基督徒，且一同在馬尼拉的聖公會聚集。
