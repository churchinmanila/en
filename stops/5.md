In 1922, Watchman  Nee, Leland Wang and his wife broke bread together for the first time in Wang’s home outside the division of denominations. Thus was born the church in Foochow.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
In the first half of 1922, having seen the light about the error of denominations, Watchman Nee, Leland Wang, and his wife took the bold step of breaking bread in Wang’s home instead of going to the denomination to receive communion. Watchman Nee later testified that he would never forget, even in eternity, the profound closeness to the heavens he felt that night. Thus was born the church in Foochow, Fujian province, standing firm outside the division of the denominations.
