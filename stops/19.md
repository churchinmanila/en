After the war, the two co-workers, Brothers Meek and Wu, appointed nine elders (including themselves plus Brother Ting) and 24 deacons and deaconesses to serve. The post-war situation left people preoccupied with their livelihoods, causing them to gradually lose their love for the Lord. The spiritual condition of the saints grew bleak, and the supply of the word became stale. It was not uncommon for the chaplain of American soldiers to be asked to fill in and give the message on Lord’s Day. During this time, a popular catchphrase among the saints was “opening canned goods,” meaning that the speaking was no longer fresh, that they were old stock. As a result, meeting attendance steadily declined. In this stale backdrop, the co-workers, elders, and deacons/deaconesses once again sought help from Brother Witness Lee.
