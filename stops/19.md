Witness Lee stayed in the house of Brother Huang Ho Seng and his sister, Ng Chu Ai — the same pair of siblings who extended hospitality to Watchman Nee thirteen years earlier. Their house stood on the very ground where the History Center stands today.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Afterward, arrangements were made for him to stay in the house of Brother Huang Ho Seng and his sister, Ng Chu Ai - the same siblings who extended hospitality to Watchman Nee thirteen years earlier. 

It is of great historic significance to note that the very ground where you stand today is where the house once stood that accommodated both Watchman Nee and Witness Lee!
