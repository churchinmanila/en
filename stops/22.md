Brother Lee planned to gradually rearrange the services, given his limited time in Manila. But he promptly established the deacon's office and appointed two sisters – Mercy Chen and Betty Ong – to serve and establish principles for all services.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
For the time being, Brother Lee opted to retain all personnel and positions in order to seek guidance from the Lord before making any changes. However, he emphasized the importance of discontinuing the old practices and initiating new ones. He promptly established the deacon's office and appointed two sisters — Mercy Chen and Betty Ong – to serve and establish principles for all services. Given Brother Lee's commitments in Taiwan during this period, his time in Manila was limited. He planned to gradually rearrange the services of the elders and deacons, as well as the work of the co-workers.
