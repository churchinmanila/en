The meeting hall in Gandara Street was burned down during the war.

<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Thus, toward the end of World War II, the meeting hall in Gandara was burned down. 

Shortly afterward, the church purchased a piece of land and built a meeting hall on Soler Street. Externally, they became known as Christian Gospel Center while internally retaining the name Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel. 

在Gandara的會所在第二世界大戰既將結束前被焚毀。

不久之後，召會買地自建會所於Soler街，外面改稱為「基督徒聚會所」，裏頭還仍舊用Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel。
