<!--- TRANSCRIPT
Thus, toward the end of World War II, the meeting hall in Gandara was burned down. 

Shortly afterward, the church purchased a piece of land and built a meeting hall on Soler Street. Externally, they became known as Christian Gospel Center while internally retaining the name Chinese Christian Gospel Chapel.
