Eventually, in 1969, all those who were sanctified and loved the Lord out of a pure heart, who gave themselves for Christ and the church, stood as one and obtained a piece of land to erect a new meeting hall in the central district of the city at 1007 Ongpin Street. This became the present-day Meeting Hall #1 of the church in Manila.
